# pdfrip

ignore me. this is just a one-off hack that I'm using to get a bunch of PDF documents in zipfiles with readable texts into a database (and silently ignore any PDF that doesn't have readable text).  I would have used Python for this, but pipenv decided to barf on every library that can ostensibly get text out of PDFs, and I don't feel like figuring out the latest python dependency management nightmare, so I'm using swift as a scripting language instead. :-)
